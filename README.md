# Weather App

A weather app that showcases a variety of items. After inputting a city, at the top you'll receive the city name, temperature, max and min temp, and the "feels like".

Right under, you'll see an icon with a description of the weather, humidity levels, and wind speed.

All of this is inside a card with a calming gradient and a city background.
